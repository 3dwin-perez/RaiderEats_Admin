# Project Overview



This project is a mobile application built with Flutter framework, Dart programming language, and Firebase as the database. The application, Raider One, integrates two primary applications: Raider Eats and Raider Ride.

The Admin page of the Raider Eats application is used to actively monitor and manage users, riders, and sellers who have registered with the application through Texas Tech University. Admins can view the earnings that sellers have made, and they have the ability to block sellers or drivers if needed. 
 Admins can also view the earnings of riders who are actively delivering food, ensuring that everyone is being fairly compensated for their work. The Admin page serves as a crucial tool for maintaining the integrity of the Raider Eats platform and ensuring that all parties involved are following the rules and regulations set forth by the university.
